# The project structure

### Initial proposition: Five elements

![Graphical representation](img/project_structure.png =20x20)

1. info
    * Metadata (libraries, colours, etc.), docs
2. code
    * Scripts, pipelines, anything with code that manages the data/results.
3. data
    * Raw and pre-processed files.
4. results
    *  Pipeline reports (figures, tables)
5. figures
    * Final figures going into the paper
    - compendium: figures that don't have a panel assigned (usually this is exploration).
    - figure_1, figure_2, ... supp_tables.
